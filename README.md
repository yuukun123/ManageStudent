# Hi, I'm Yuu

### I'm a student of Sài Gòn University

##### This is my first project in Python, using PyQT with SQLite database and running on Python 3.10. I completed this project with the help of ChatGPT and Gemini. This is my first time using GUI and creating a small project to support lecturers to view information about the assigned class and enter midterm, final and final grade columns on a 10-point scale, it may not be the same as the real thing because I have refined some functions and some other functions are still not done.

##### How to install the dependencies of the project 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##### How to run the project
```
python main.py or open project go to src folder and run main.py
```
